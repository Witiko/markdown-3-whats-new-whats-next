Dialogue: 0,0:17:34.40,0:17:38.56,Default,,0,0,0,,because the changes between Markdown 2 and 3 are substantial.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.56,0:17:39.94,Default,,0,0,0,,More on that later.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:46.54,0:17:49.60,Default,,0,0,0,,The first reason why the current release of Markdown 3.0
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.60,0:17:53.16,Default,,0,0,0,,is marked as an alpha release is due to a number of open issues.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:53.72,0:17:57.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Namely, the implementation of CommonMark has introduced memory leaks.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:57.30,0:18:01.86,Default,,0,0,0,,These have been hotfixed in the alpha but will need a proper fix before the stable release.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.54,0:18:08.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, the implementation of CommonMark has increased the number of unit tests 6×,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.58,0:18:13.80,Default,,0,0,0,,which has caused performance issues with our continuous integration service.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:13.80,0:18:17.88,Default,,0,0,0,,In the alpha, we have temporarily reduced the number of TeX engines
Dialogue: 0,0:18:17.88,0:18:23.40,Default,,0,0,0,,that are automatically tested, but this may have caused us to miss regressions
Dialogue: 0,0:18:23.40,0:18:24.80,Default,,0,0,0,,in other TeX engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:24.80,0:18:28.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Therefore, we will need to improve the speed of unit tests,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.80,0:18:34.72,Default,,0,0,0,,restore the full testing, and then see if any regressions have been introduced
Dialogue: 0,0:18:34.72,0:18:37.24,Default,,0,0,0,,in the meantime before the stable release.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.24,0:18:41.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Lastly, the implementation of attributes in the Markdown package
Dialogue: 0,0:18:41.14,0:18:45.76,Default,,0,0,0,,is slightly incompatible with other implementations, such as Pandoc,

Dialogue: 0,0:19:14.36,0:19:19.42,Default,,0,0,0,,which we think will be quite useful to authors who need to reference their tables from the text.

Dialogue: 0,0:20:37.70,0:20:41.30,Default,,0,0,0,,which has previously caused all line breaks in markdown source
Dialogue: 0,0:20:41.30,0:20:47.08,Default,,0,0,0,,to produce a line break in the output, which can be useful for example when typesetting poetry.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:48.02,0:20:54.38,Default,,0,0,0,,In Markdown 3, however, all line breaks in markdown text produce a soft line break TeX macro,

Dialogue: 0,0:24:19.78,0:24:24.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Although it is best to use a template developed by a TeXpert,
Dialogue: 0,0:24:24.56,0:24:29.08,Default,,0,0,0,,the Markdown package provides default formatting definitions for most elements,

Dialogue: 0,0:24:31.58,0:24:35.28,Default,,0,0,0,,However, these default definitions are often insufficient
Dialogue: 0,0:24:35.28,0:24:39.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and they also clutter up the code base of the Markdown package.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:41.38,0:24:44.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Currently, TeXperts can also use a concept of a theme,

Dialogue: 0,0:24:56.44,0:25:00.98,Default,,0,0,0,,to have multiple formatting definitions for different TeX formats.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:00.98,0:25:06.42,Default,,0,0,0,,And, using this new tech, we are planning to
Dialogue: 0,0:25:06.42,0:25:09.98,Default,,0,0,0,,create a single default theme that would encompass

Dialogue: 0,0:25:13.58,0:25:17.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and this theme would then be maintained separately from the Markdown package,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:17.84,0:25:22.30,Default,,0,0,0,,so that it would allow for a more serious implementation than what we have now,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:22.30,0:25:26.90,Default,,0,0,0,,which is a placeholder in absence of a proper template.

Dialogue: 0,0:27:04.92,0:27:08.20,Chair,,0,0,0,,You write a .md file for markdown
Dialogue: 0,0:27:08.20,0:27:13.72,Chair,,0,0,0,,and you can convert it to a printed version using TeX
Dialogue: 0,0:27:13.72,0:27:16.66,Chair,,0,0,0,,but can you convert it to a .tex file?
Dialogue: 0,0:27:16.66,0:27:20.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, the Markdown package provides a Lua command-line interface,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.92,0:27:24.98,Default,,0,0,0,,which you can use to take a markdown file
Dialogue: 0,0:27:24.98,0:27:29.20,Default,,0,0,0,,and convert it to this intermediate representation in TeX macros
Dialogue: 0,0:27:29.20,0:27:31.38,Default,,0,0,0,,and you can then use it as you like.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:31.38,0:27:32.64,Chair,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:33.72,0:27:35.38,Chair,,0,0,0,,Are there any questions?
Dialogue: 0,0:27:41.54,0:27:43.58,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,To be honest, I am a bit skeptical.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:43.58,0:27:47.86,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,Do you really need yet another markup language?
Dialogue: 0,0:27:47.86,0:27:52.20,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,LaTeX is a well-defined language already
Dialogue: 0,0:27:52.20,0:27:55.76,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,but some people say: “Oh, that's far too complicated for me,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:55.76,0:27:57.66,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,I need a simpler one.”
Dialogue: 0,0:27:57.66,0:28:01.96,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,But, the more features you add to your markup language,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:01.96,0:28:05.12,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,the smaller this advantage gets
Dialogue: 0,0:28:05.12,0:28:11.58,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,and two number signs, are they really
Dialogue: 0,0:28:11.58,0:28:16.34,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,more readable than a section command call for instance?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:16.62,0:28:20.64,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,And lots of problems
Dialogue: 0,0:28:20.64,0:28:24.56,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,and the more special characters you defined,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:24.56,0:28:28.78,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,the more nasty surprises the users will get with all documents,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:28.78,0:28:34.56,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,because suddenly, a special character has a special meaning,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:34.56,0:28:37.36,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,rather than to be presented in verbatim mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:37.36,0:28:41.58,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,So, I see a lot of problems
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.58,0:28:46.00,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,with just another markup language, more problems than advantages,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:46.00,0:28:48.26,Audience member #1 (Michael Schlüter),,0,0,0,,which is more a remark than a question.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:48.86,0:28:52.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Right, I am not sure what the question exactly was.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:52.26,0:28:54.46,Default,,0,0,0,,I will address some of the points that you raised.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:54.46,0:28:59.98,Default,,0,0,0,,In LaTeX, there is even a concept of a document markup language,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:59.98,0:29:03.84,Default,,0,0,0,,where LaTeX2e is one possible markup language
Dialogue: 0,0:29:03.84,0:29:09.02,Default,,0,0,0,,but the LaTeX project assumes that there will be several markup languages,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:09.02,0:29:13.68,Default,,0,0,0,,which the authors can use and which the backend will be independent on,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:13.68,0:29:17.94,Default,,0,0,0,,so it will all be LaTeX but there will be different markup languages
Dialogue: 0,0:29:17.94,0:29:19.94,Default,,0,0,0,,that the authors can use.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:20.88,0:29:27.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the idea of adding another markup language
Dialogue: 0,0:29:27.24,0:29:32.14,Default,,0,0,0,,is part of the ethos, I think, of the LaTeX project.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:32.14,0:29:36.58,Default,,0,0,0,,You also mentioned special characters, which may cause trouble.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:36.58,0:29:39.36,Default,,0,0,0,,When we are typesetting the markdown text,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:39.36,0:29:41.58,Default,,0,0,0,,we switch to a special catcode regime,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:41.58,0:29:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,so that should not be a problem
Dialogue: 0,0:29:42.80,0:29:46.60,Default,,0,0,0,,but we switch back, whenever you have this raw TeX block,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:46.60,0:29:49.96,Default,,0,0,0,,where you are using your own TeX macros,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:49.96,0:29:54.68,Default,,0,0,0,,so this should not cause any trouble for you as the user.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.40,0:30:02.22,Chair,,0,0,0,,Any other question?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:11.76,0:30:15.00,Audience member #2 (Henri Menke),,0,0,0,,Not really question but just a comment / offer.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:15.00,0:30:16.50,Audience member #2 (Henri Menke),,0,0,0,,You have a Matrix.org channel,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:16.50,0:30:23.42,Audience member #2 (Henri Menke),,0,0,0,,I would be happy to take that under the TUG Matrix.org space umbrella,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:23.42,0:30:25.98,Audience member #2 (Henri Menke),,0,0,0,,so you could just contact me after the session.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:25.98,0:30:27.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, thanks!
Dialogue: 0,0:30:29.24,0:30:32.18,Chair,,0,0,0,,Any other question? So, yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:35.66,0:30:38.80,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,By the time you added tables and YAML support,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:38.80,0:30:41.88,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,you are quite close to GitHub-flavored markdown,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:41.88,0:30:45.60,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,which many people know from GitHub pages and places.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:45.60,0:30:48.96,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,would you have defaults or are you envisaging support
Dialogue: 0,0:30:48.96,0:30:53.04,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,for specific flavors of markdown apart from CommonMark?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:53.72,0:30:57.40,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,GitHub pages, in particular, is quite common.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:57.40,0:31:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the question is whether we would be open to supporting
Dialogue: 0,0:31:01.02,0:31:04.16,Default,,0,0,0,,other flavors of markdown other than CommonMark.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:02.56,0:31:06.70,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,Yes, I mean, the table support is obviously very close
Dialogue: 0,0:31:06.70,0:31:08.48,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,to the GitHub table extension
Dialogue: 0,0:31:08.48,0:31:12.54,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,and they also have YAML at the top,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:12.54,0:31:15.86,Audience member #3,,0,0,0,,so you are already, I guess, pretty close to GitHub.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:18.52,0:31:22.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Right, so, I am not sure I caught the entire question,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:22.42,0:31:25.56,Default,,0,0,0,,but just to answer the point about CommonMark:
Dialogue: 0,0:31:25.56,0:31:30.98,Default,,0,0,0,,No, we are currently only... Like, the plan is to support CommonMark
Dialogue: 0,0:31:30.98,0:31:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and if you need to supply documents in a different markup format,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:36.68,0:31:38.68,Default,,0,0,0,,including different dialects of markdown,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:38.68,0:31:40.36,Default,,0,0,0,,you first convert to CommonMark.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:40.36,0:31:42.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so that is the plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:46.76,0:31:47.82,Chair,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:51.38,0:31:55.42,Audience member #4 (Barbara Beeton),,0,0,0,,Did you prepare your slides with Markdown or with something else?
